My future career hopefully lies in the Bay Area working on websites for a mid size established company. Once I graduate, I will dive head first into making that happen.

I realize a lot of people graduating from college may be open to opportunities anywhere, but I picked the San Francisco area because there are whales not just part of the year, but all year round. Half of the year it’s gray whales, and half of the year it’s humpback whales. It’s just perfectly situated to catch them on their migrations at opposing times.

So why whales? Well, whale watching is the ultimate de-stressor for me. I never feel lighter and more at peace than when I see a whale in the wild. I first noticed this in 2016, but now, as I will soon achieve a new degree, I am in a good position to make the move. I just have to find a job first.

I have the most knowledge and experience surrounding websites. I’ve worked with them a lot before, and my degree only added to that knowledge. Therefore, I expect to find a job in that arena.

Fortunately, there is, as I understand it, a good market for my industry in the Bay Area. Everything from start-ups to giant companies can be found there, but I have done pretty well with small to mid-size companies that are fairly well established. They seem to have a good idea of what they are doing, and they can really care about investing in their employees, though there are exceptions.

My next step is to talk to a career counselor at the school. That is happening today. I want advice on my resume and some tips related to my job search. Then, in a few weeks when I finish my classes, I will really get into the job listing sites and start applying. I will probably also refine my GitHub account.

I’m excited and apprehensive about beginning my new life, as anyone might be in finding and starting a new job in a place where they know no one. I’m hopeful, though, that I can make it happen.
